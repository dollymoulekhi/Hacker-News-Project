# Hacker News : Know the right time - for getting advice from HACKER NEWS Expert

In this study we will explore posts that were posted on *Hacker News*. Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

Some posts can easily attract a lot of views, and comments. In this study we will explore aspects that impact the amount of comments for a post.

- Post title: when creating posts, users can - optionally - add Ask HN or Show HN to the title of the post. They do so to explicitly 'ask' or 'show' something to the Hacker News community. We'll analyze whether posts with these tags receive more comments on average.

- Post timing: also, we will explore whether posts published at certain times receive more comments on average.
